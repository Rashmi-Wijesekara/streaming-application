<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

1. Run the following command inside the /client, /api, and /rtmp-server directories</p>

```
npm install
```

2. Then run the following command inside all the given 3 directories to start the API server, client, and rtmp-server.
```
npm start
```

3. Install the OBS Studio software
[https://obsproject.com/download](https://obsproject.com/download)

4. Go to the localhost:3000 URL where the React app is running and login to the application by using a google account. Then create a stream by entering relavent details.

5. After creating a stream, the page will be redirected to the streaming list. In there, click on the stream that you just created.

6. Then you will be redirected to a URL like this, `http://localhost:3000/streams/2` where `2` is the stream ID that you just created.

7. In OBS, go to Settings -> Stream,
```
Stream Type: Custom Streaming Server
URL: rtmp://localhost/live
Streaming key: Stream ID
```
The stream ID would be the ID of the stream that you just created. In my case, it's `2`.

8.After changing the settings, Click on `Start Streaming` in OBS and you will see the live stream of yours in the web application as well.
